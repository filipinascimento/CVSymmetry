Example for calculating the symmetries in http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0224

Calculating symmetries up to level 4:

./CVSymmetry -c -M -l 4 inputnetwork.xnet output.tsv

HELP:

Usage: ./CVSymmetry [options] -i|<inputnetwork> [<outputfile>]
Options:
  -l  --level h            Obtain simmetry up to h steps.
                           (defaults to h=3)
  -p  --path-diversity     Also outputs path-.
  -M  --merge-last-level   Merge last level.
  -P  --output-probs       Also output the access probabilities for each
                           pair of nodes.
  -r  --output-reachable   Also output the number of reachable nodes
                           alongside simmetry.
  -a  --output-accessed    Also output the number of accessed nodes
                           calculated from non normalized accessibility.
  -d  --output-degree      Also output the degree of each node.
  -D  --output-avg-degree  Also output the average degree of pattern.
  -C  --output-cluscoeff   Also output the clustering coeff. of nodes.
  -B  --output-betweenness Also output the betweenness centrality.
  -T  --output-stress      Also output the stress centrality.
  -c  --export-csv         Export all data in CSV (tab delimited) format.
  -m  --export-multiple    Export all data in a multiple files based on the
                           output file name.
  -s  --live-stream        Stream the output as results are obtained.
                           (note that the results may be out of order)
  -j  --parallel-jobs N    Maximum number of parallel jobs for multicore
                           calculation. (defaults to N=8)
  -h  --help               Display this usage information.
  -V  --version            Show version number and quit.
  -v  --verbose            Make the calculation more talkative.
  -q  --quiet              Don not show calculation progress.
  -S  --show-status        Always show calculation progress.
Input:
  <inputnetwork>           Path to the network file in .xnet format.
  -i  --input-stdin        Uses stdin as input instead of a file.
  <outputfile>             Path to output the results. (If not defined, 
                           the software will output to stdout)
